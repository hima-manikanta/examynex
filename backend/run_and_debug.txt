I understand that you're encountering errors. To help you fix them, I need to see the specific error messages from your system. I have made significant changes to the codebase, including adding new dependencies, which might be the source of the problem if they are not installed.

Please follow these steps and then paste the complete error output back to me:

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory** of the project:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project/backend
    ```

3.  **It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.** If you have one for this project, activate it. If not, you can create one by running:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    And activate it:
    - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install the required packages** from the `requirments.txt` file I created:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirments.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the FastAPI application:**
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

After you run the last command, the terminal will show the application loading. If there are any errors, they will be printed there. **Please copy everything from the terminal and paste it in your reply.** This will give me the information I need to identify and solve the problem.
